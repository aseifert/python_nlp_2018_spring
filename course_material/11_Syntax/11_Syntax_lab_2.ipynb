    "Modify `parse()` so that it returns the parse tree. In the original CKY algorithm, each nonterminal maintains backpointers to its children. Instead, we will build the `Tree` object directly (which is little more that a label and a list of backpointers, really).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things you should do here:\n",
    "1. When filling a cell: instead of adding the name of the nonterminal to the list in the cell, add a `Tree` with the name as label and the right children. The constructor's signature is `Tree(node, children)`, where the latter is a `list`.\n",
    "2. Change your method to be a _generator_: yield all `Tree`s from the top right cell whose label is `S`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget that `Tree.label()`s are strings, so if you want to look for them in `grammar.productions()`, enclose them into a `Nonterminal` object."
